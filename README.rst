Changelog
=========

      [2011-06-10, `pielgrzym`_]

    * Adding ``css.snippets`` from `tisho`_
      (https://github.com/tisho/css-snippets-snipmate)
      [2011-04-17, `garbas`_]

    * Lots of updates to snippets.

    * Made the trigger key configurable, https://github.com/garbas/vim-snipmate/pull/4.
      [2011-04-13, `thenoseman`_]

    * Handle single-line or multiline snippets.
      [2011-03-22, `johnbintz`_]

      [2011-03-16, `blueyed`_]

    * Add snippets file for "diff" filetype and add bang to function
      definitons, allowing for reload.
      [2011-03-06, `blueyed`_]

    * Update snipmate to handle latest supertab version.
      [2011-02-09, `ervandew`_]

    * Updated README: added contributors, instructions how to install snipMate,
      some spellchecking of my wonderful English, added this Changelog
      [2011-02-07, `garbas`_]

    * Fixed bug: When leaving a placeholder unchanged and trying to jump to the
      next placeholder, the text of the first placeholder would get cleared.
      [2011-06-16, `jgosmann`_]

    * From below mentioned merges I must specially mention `MarcWeber`_'s patch
      which brought quite a few functionalities/improvements:
        - snippets are loaded lazily and they are cached. Recaching takes place
          automatically when file's timestamp changes
        - When visually selecting a snippet in a .snippets file you can press
          <cr> to replace spaces by tabs automatically in a smart way.
      Big +1 to `MarcWeber`_ for this. Important to note is that we now depend
      on `vim-addon-mw-utils`_ and `tlib`_.
      [2011-02-02, `garbas`_]

    * Merged pull requests of `MarcWeber`_, `lilydjwg`_, `henrik`_, `steveno`_,
      `asymmetric`_, `jherdman`_, `ironcamel`_, `honza`_, `jb55`_,
      `robhudson`_, `kozo2`_, `MicahElliott`_, `darkwise`_, `redpill`_,
      `thisgeek`_, `sickill`_, `pose`_,
      [2011-02-02, `garbas`_]

How to install
==============

Unfortunately there are many ways to install vim plugins. If you don't
see your preferred way of installation, please consider updating
this section. Basically, installation consists of 2 simple steps:

1. Install vim-snipmate
2. Install snippets


snipmate dependencies
==============
Important to note is that since version 1.0 we depend on 2 vim plugins:
    * `vim-addon-mw-utils`_ providing the implementation for caching parsed
      .snippets files.

    * `tlib`_ for tlib#input#List which provides the excellent filterable
      list selection view (and more).

    * the default set of snippets (optional but recommended).
      See 'Snippets repository' below.


Using `VAM`_ (recommended)
------------

- Add `snipmate-snippets` to the names to be installed. Or use
  "github:name/repo" if you want to use a non standard upstream.

The default snippets depend on "snipmate" so VAM will fetch the core along
with its dependencies automatically.

Using `pathogen`_
--------------------------------------

::

    % cd ~/.vim
    % mkdir bundle
    % cd bundle
    % git clone git://github.com/garbas/vim-snipmate.git

    # Install dependencies:
    % git clone https://github.com/tomtom/tlib_vim.git
    % git clone https://github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-mw-utils.git
    % git clone https://github.com/honza/snipmate-snippets.git

Using `Vundle`_
---------------

::

    Install dependencies:
    Bundle "MarcWeber/vim-addon-mw-utils"
    Bundle "tomtom/tlib_vim"
    Bundle "honza/snipmate-snippets"

    Install:
    Bundle "garbas/vim-snipmate"

    And :BundleInstall



Manually (not recommended!)
---------------------------

::

    % git clone git://github.com/honza/snipmate-snippets.git
    % git clone git://github.com/garbas/vim-snipmate.git
    % cd snipmate.vim
    % cp -R * ~/.vim

Then in vim::

    :helptags ~/.vim/doc/

Then install any dependencies (see above).

Snippets repository
===================
There is now one snippet repo containing almost all snippets. You are
encouraged to submit any fixes and new snippets there.

https://github.com/honza/snipmate-snippets

We also encourage people to maintain sets of snippets for particular use cases
so that all users can benefit from them.  People can list their snippet repositories here:

     * https://github.com/rbonvall/snipmate-snippets-bib (snippets for BibTeX files)
     * https://github.com/sudar/vim-arduino-snippets (snippets for Arduino files)
     * https://github.com/zedr/zope-snipmate-bundle.git (snippets for Python, TAL and ZCML)

Installation using VAM: "github:rbonvall/snipmate-snippets-bib"

Why forking snipMate?
=====================

    After several unsuccessful attempts of contacting Michael Sanders, no
    commits in last half year and long pull request line on github (none of
    pull requests were commented/replied/rejected) I decided to take action,
    step up and bring some love to this widely used plugin.

    But nothing to worry about. We all get busy, accupied with our daily work
    or just lose interest in doing boring maintainance.

    While reviewing pull requests on github.com/msanders I found lots of great
    improvements and I decided to **friendly** fork it, review and apply patches
    that were sent, notify all the patch submitters and decided to maintain
    snipmate.vim from now on. Of course if somebody wants to
    help, please do not hesitate to write me, I am open to any suggestions.

    Maybe I will only maintain it for a while until Michael Sanders takes things
    back into his hand or until some other super-hero shows up.

    Tnx and happy snipmating, Rok Garbas & Marc Weber, 2011-02-02

Known Bugs
=============

    * Set one value default as input of another value.
      https://github.com/garbas/vim-snipmate/issues/59
      [2011-10-18, `bogdan`_]


TODO / Future
=============

    * Notify all "forkers" about new home and ask them nicely to review already
      merged changes and possibly send their changes.
      [2011-02-07, `garbas`_]

    * I'd like to investigate whether xptemplate or snipmate has the better
      engine. So maybe my vision of the future could be making xptemplate read
      snippet files. It is not important enough for me to work on it right now as
      snipmate works reasonable well for me.
      [2011-02-02, `MarcWeber`_]

    * comment without verifying it:
      < Silex> MarcWeber: btw, check out ultisnips. Much better than snipmate imho

      And before this discussion xptemplate vs snipmate vs ultisnips .. continues
      we should create a wiki page comparing them and keep that up to date.
      If you volunteer tell me so that I can reference the link.
      [2011-02-02, `MarcWeber`_]

    * tcomment claims to know which language mode you're editing in even if its
      JS in PHP or HTML within PHP. It would be great if that functionality could be
      moved into its own plugirn (vim-detect-language-at-cursor) or such.
      Then a lot of the scoped_aliases (which causes collisions easily) could
      be enhanced.
